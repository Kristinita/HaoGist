# Gist Plugin for Sublime
As you know, there already has a <a href="https://github.com/condemil/Gist">sublime gist plugin</a>, however, there is no cache handler and it seems the author already stop to develop on it, so I decide to develop this gist plugin.

## Installation
This plugin will be hosted on [package control](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/HaoGist) in the soon later.
